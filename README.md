# Code-Alpha_Task-3
Developed a Chatbot problem using python for Code Alpha internship.
Overview
This project aims to build a chatbot using Python that can handle various user inputs, provide relevant responses, and improve over time with user interaction. The goal is to showcase how conversational AI can be implemented in Python through natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and APIs.

Project Structure
The chatbot uses a combination of NLP libraries, such as NLTK or spaCy, and machine learning models to interpret user input and provide intelligent responses. The project is designed to handle different conversation topics, such as:

Small talk (greetings, farewells)
Basic information retrieval (date, time, weather)
Math calculations
Custom user queries

Requirements
This project requires the following Python packages:

nltk - Natural Language Toolkit, for text processing and tokenization
spacy - NLP library for advanced text processing
scikit-learn - For machine learning models (optional, for more complex bots)
requests - For making HTTP requests (e.g., weather API)
tensorflow - If using deep learning models (optional)
Flask - If deploying the chatbot as a web service (optional)
To install the dependencies, run the following:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Features
Natural Language Processing: The chatbot uses basic NLP techniques to process user inputs, including tokenization and stemming.
Machine Learning: A model is trained using pre-labeled datasets to classify user intents and respond appropriately.
Customizable: Users can extend the chatbot by adding new intents and responses to the data file.
Weather Information: The chatbot can fetch weather information by integrating with a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
Math Calculations: It supports basic arithmetic calculations.
How to Use
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git
cd chatbot-project
Install required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model (if applicable):

If you're using a machine learning approach, ensure that the intents.json file contains all the necessary training data. Then run the training script to build the model.


python train_model.py
Run the chatbot:

For a basic text-based interface:


python main.py
Alternatively, if you've integrated with Flask to deploy a web-based chatbot:


python app.py
Interact with the chatbot through the terminal or web interface. You can ask it questions like:

"Hello"
"What's the weather like?"
"What is 2 + 2?"
"Tell me a joke."
